Explanation:
This C++ program takes two integers as input from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The results of these operations are then displayed on the screen. The program uses typecasting to ensure correct floating-point division when dividing the two integers. It demonstrates fundamental concepts such as input/output, basic arithmetic, and typecasting in C++.
