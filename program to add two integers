This C++ program asks the user to enter two numbers. It then adds these two numbers together and shows the result. The sum is stored in a variable called `sum`, and the program prints the result in a clear format like "first_number + second_number = sum". This program is a basic example of taking input, performing addition, and displaying the output.
