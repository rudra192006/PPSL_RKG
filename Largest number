#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int a;
int b; 
int c;
cout <<"Put any three numbers: "<<endl;
cin>>a;
cin>>b;
cin>>c;
if(a>=b && a>=c) 
{
cout<<"The Largest number is: "<<a;
}
if(b>=a && b>=c) 
{
cout<<"The Largest number is: "<<b;
}
if(c>=a && c>=b) 
{
cout<<"The Largest number is: "<<c;
}
return 0;
}
Explanation:
the program compares all three numbers(a,b,c) and finds the largest by ensuring that one number is greater than or equal to the other two. The "&&" operator makes sure that both comparisons are true before determining which number is the largest.
