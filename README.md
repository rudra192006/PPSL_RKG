This C++ program defines a class Car with three public attributes: brand, model, and year. In the main function, two objects of the Car class (carObj1 and carObj2) are created. The attributes of each object are assigned values, such as "Mahindra" for the brand of carObj1 and "Toyota" for carObj2. The program then prints out the values of these attributes for each car object. Finally, the program ends by returning 0 to indicate successful execution
